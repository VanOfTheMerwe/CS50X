# CS50X
## About The Course:
This course is from Harvard, presented by David Malan. 
In this project I learned about the different programming languages, such as:
- C
- Python
- JavaScript

As well as other languages such as:
- SQL
- HTML
- CSS.
 
I learned about the backend and the frontend development, web development and some managing skills for databases. 

## Backend:
For backend the projects started with C, then we later moved on to programming with Python. 

## Frontend:
For the last few projects I had web development projects where I had to use HTML and CSS for the styling of the web pages. 

## Web Development:
For the web development projects I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For the last web project I used Flask to create it. With Flask I used Python for the backend of the web app.
